# foundations-landing-page
A landing page to practice building website from scratch.

I will use the concepts from the Odin Project to build a webpage from scratch by creating an html document index.html and a stylesheet styles.css.

The webpage will include a header, footer, and 4 horizontal information sections. I will predominantly be using flexbox to create this layout.
